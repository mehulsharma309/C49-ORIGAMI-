    <ul>
        <li>This model is absolutely incredible. 
        It’s folded from a single 80cm x 80cm square of paper and must have taken forever to fold all the individual scales which aren’t part of the original design.</li>
        <li>The head is probably my favourite part about this model but the wings, tail, legs, body and whole thing looks incredible.</li>
    </ul>
